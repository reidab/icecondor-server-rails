IceCondor takes advantage of map coordinates in RSS feeds (called GeoRSS feeds) and displays
them as markers on a map. IceCondor works with multiple services including 
<a href="http://brightkite.com">Brightkite</a>, <a href="http://shizzow.com">Shizzow</a>, 
and <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming.org</a>. 
 </p>
 <p>
IceCondor can optionally track the phones location with GPS and publish it
on this site with privacy control. <a href="/dashboard/map">Look here for a map of users with a
public location</a>.
